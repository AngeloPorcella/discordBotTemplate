# discordBotTemplate
This is a template for a discord bot

There is some minor funcionality that should be easy to implement based on this skeleton, this includes:

    Joining a VC and playing specified audio files (set up for mp3's only currently)
    Sending a welcome message to a new member via DM
    Replying to keywords with a random GIF/sentence of your choosing
First, follow this guide to get your token for the bot (This will be pasted in the secret .env file):

Next pip install the imports listed in the file.

Finally install FFMPEG if you want to utilize the voice chat/mp3 playing capabilities.

And you should be off to the races!
